Obfuscating ntpd
================

This is a minimalistic and incomplete implementation of SNTP for the sole purpose
of faking time and spreading clients out e.g. distributing client times in a
certain time range e.g. +-10 Minutes.

Source for the offset is the clients ip address so subsequent requests get
the very same offset.

It has been used to spread out disconnection times of a malfunctioning
CPE/Home Router timed event.

Building
========

You will need libevent-dev and pkg-config installed. Simply type make.
